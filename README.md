# CodeAcademy_Python_TomeRater
TomeRater Python project

The TomeRater.py file includes all the basic items asked for in the instructions. For the analytical functions such as highest_rated_book(), I chose to print the output in sentence format instead of just returning the output. For the additional analytical item requested at the end of the instructions, I chose to add a price variable and I created the get_n_most_expensive_books() function.

I modified the populate.py file and included it.
